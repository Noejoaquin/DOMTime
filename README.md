# DOMTime

Inspired by jQuery, DOMTime is a  JavaScript DOM manipulation library that
traverses the DOM using vanilla JavaScript.

Users can:
* Create `DOMNodeCollection` objects from `HTMLElement`s
* Traverse the DOM and alter elements on the page
* Construct DOM elements
* Create a queue of functions that will run when the DOM is fully loaded
